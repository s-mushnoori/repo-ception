## About
This is a list of all my complete and ongoing data science projects, from most recent to oldest. Since these are prsented in reverse order of completeion, they also show (in reverse!) how I progressed from beginner to more advanced projects in the field.

## Learning Projects
As much as I strive for perfection in some areas of my life, I still try to adhere to the philosphy of learning by doing. These projects are meant to explore a few concepts at a time to develop an intuitive undrstanding of how certain algorithms or concepts work. In some cases, I may revisit older projects and apply some additional ideas to them.

#### Machine Learning (sklearn)
|Project|Algorithm|Description|Result|
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
|[boston-housing](https://github.com/s-mushnoori/boston-housing)|Linear Regression|Explored a Boston housing dataset: Performed basic feature engineering, and predictive modelling|-|
|[knn-project](https://github.com/s-mushnoori/knn-project)|k-Nearest Neighbors|Explored a dataset of unknown features and trained a classification model|Trained and tuned KNN model to achieve ~83% accuracy|
|[predicting-diabetes](https://github.com/s-mushnoori/predicting-diabetes)|k-Nearest Neighbors|Explored a medical dataset and trained a classification model to predict patients with diabetes|Trained and tuned KN model to achieve ~75% accuracy|
|[loan-repayment](https://github.com/s-mushnoori/loan-repayment)|Random Forest|Developed a predicive model on data from Lending Club to identifiy borrowers less likely to repay loans|Trained and tuned a random forest model to achieve ~84% accuracy|
|[titanic](https://github.com/s-mushnoori/titanic)|Linear Regression, Random Forest|Developed classification models on the famous titanic dataset to figure predict which passengers survived|Achieved 85% and 82% accuracy using Logistic Regression and Random Forest respectively|
