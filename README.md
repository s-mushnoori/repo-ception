## About
This is a list of all my complete and ongoing data science projects, from most recent to oldest. Since these are presented in reverse order of completeion, they also show (in reverse!) how I progressed from beginner to more advanced projects in the field.

## Learning Projects
These projects are meant to explore a few concepts at a time to develop an intuitive undrstanding of how certain algorithms or concepts work. In some cases, I may revisit older projects and apply some additional ideas to them.

#### Machine Learning (sklearn)
