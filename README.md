## Learning Projects
As much as I strive for perfection in some areas of my life, I still try to adhere to the philosphy of learning by doing. These projects are meant to explore a few concepts at a time to develop an intuitive undrstanding of how certain algorithms or concepts work. In some cases, I may revisit older projects and apply some additional ideas to them.

#### Data Preparation / Data Visulization
|Project|Description|
|:--:|:--|
|[visualizing-gender-gap](https://github.com/s-mushnoori/visualizing-gender-gap)|Visualized the gender gap in different fields|
|[visualizing-earnings](https://github.com/s-mushnoori/visualizing-earnings)|Visualized earnings based on college major|
|[high-school-sat-scores](https://github.com/s-mushnoori/high-school-sat-scores)|Combined and cleaned several datasets; visualized SAT scores by region|
|[mental-health-in-tech](https://github.com/s-mushnoori/mental-health-in-tech)|Visualized survey data on mental health in the workplace|

#### Machine Learning (sklearn)
|Project|Algorithm|Description|Result|
